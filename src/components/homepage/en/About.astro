            Hey, nice to meet you
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-header mt-2 text-6xl lg:w-2/3">
            I'm Julius, and love graphic design.

            As I work with graphic design every day and from time to time take
            web development projects for almost a decade, I have gathered enough
            experience to tackle a variety of different projects. And the best
            fuel for my projects is a cup of my favourite black coffee with a
            little bit of milk and new challenges along the way.
          </p>

          >
            Time off work is likewise important, so when I can, I like to take
            hiking or biking in nature to keep my mind fresh. And my second
            passion besides design is taking rides with a motorcycle.
          </p>

            Then the day's work is done and the sun is setting down I love to
            relax in front of some good movie or a book or just get lost in the
            computer game world from time to time.
